 Until now the best-known adaptation of Hansel and Gretel has been the opera of the same name written 120 years ago by classical composer Engelbert Humperdinck.

Now Liam Scarlett - appointed artist-in-residence at the Royal Opera House in London at 26 - has created a full-length ballet about the young brother and sister who get lost in the woods and encounter an evil witch.

"The Grimm tales were always in the back of my mind as possible material for ballet. Partly it's their malicious dark side. But I also love their simplicity: they were meant for children and most are only a few pages long. The sentences are simplistic and to the point and the writing works brilliantly."

Ultimately Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm collected a couple of hundred tales. So why did Scarlett stick to one of the best-known for his new work?

"It's true the basic story is familiar, but in recent years there have been surprisingly few adaptations. Yet there are lots of modern-day references to play with.

"Hansel and Gretel deals with child abduction and a hostage situation. There's a dysfunctional family and parents in economic crisis. Then there's a malevolent stepmother who's beating the children and a cowardly father who can't even pay the rent.

"The children think they're older and better than they are: in some ways they're as conniving as the stepmother. All those things you can find in modern society too."

The production at Covent Garden has a deliberately cinematic feel. The music is by Dan Jones, who acknowledges the influence of the great Hollywood composers. (Recent work includes the music for the TV series Any Human Heart.)

"With such a dark fairytale, which we've re-set in the American mid-west, we wanted to reference the great legacy of American horror films and psychological suspense. So inevitably Hitchcock comes up and the composer Bernard Herrmann who wrote such beautiful scores for him."
